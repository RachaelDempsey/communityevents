# Data Science Hangout

A gathering place for current and aspiring data science leaders every Thursday at 12 ET .

The goal is to foster a space where we can chat about popular data science topics each week. No hard agenda or predetermined talk tracks: just an expert or two willing to share their perspectives on whatâ€™s really going on in data science at an organizational level.

Please note that these sessions are also recorded and will be shared to YouTube.
